# rm-python
Remove command rewritten using python 

This program is the rm command implemented using python. Files that are removed are stored in rm_trash located in the user home directory.
Duplicates are handled to a degree, through some file name conflicts could arise if some files are named exactly the same as files that have been removed
previously.

When -r is set, the program can remove directories.
